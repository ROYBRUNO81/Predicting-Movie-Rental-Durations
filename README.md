![DVD Image](dvd_image.jpg)

This project focuses on building regression models to predict the duration for which customers will rent DVDs, helping a rental company optimize their inventory planning. Using features such as rental rates, movie length, and replacement costs from the provided dataset, various models were tested, including Lasso regression and Random Forest. After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model achieved the best performance with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) below the target threshold of 3. The project was implemented using Python, leveraging libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib`.
